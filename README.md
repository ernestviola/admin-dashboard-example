## Lessons
When working on a larger page definitely complete the html to the best of your
ability and then while styling focus first on the general layout then style
each feature container one at a time. This will keep your stylesheet a lot
cleaner since the styles will all be grouped in similar areas.

Use the BEM class naming technique.
